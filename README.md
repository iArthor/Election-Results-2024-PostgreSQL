This project involves analyzing election results from the **India General Elections 2024** using SQL queries to derive insights into party performance, constituency results, and vote distribution. It focuses on key metrics like total seats, seats won by alliances, state-wise election results, and candidate performance.

Key Features & Insights:
- Total Seats Analysis: Determines the overall number of contested seats and distribution across states.
- Party Performance: Evaluates the success of major alliances such as **NDA**, **I.N.D.I.A**, and independent parties.
- Constituency-Level Insights: Identifies winning candidates, their vote margins, and party affiliations.
- Vote Distribution Analysis: Compares **EVM votes vs. postal votes** for candidates across constituencies.
- State-Wise Party Breakdown: Provides insights into seat distribution among different political parties per state.
- Derived Metrics: Introduces a `party_alliance` classification to group parties into NDA, I.N.D.I.A., or Others.

Tools & Technologies Used:
- PostgreSQL for data extraction, transformation, and querying complex electoral datasets.
- Relational Database Management using tables like `partywise_results`, `constituencywise_results`, and `statewise_results`.

This project provides an in-depth electoral data analysis, allowing for meaningful comparisons of party success, voter trends, and constituency-level performance.
